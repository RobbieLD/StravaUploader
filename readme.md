## Installation
1. Simply download te `StravaUploader.exe` from the releases page along with the `appsettings.json` file. This is the master config for the app and needs to be in the same directory as the app.
2. Update `appsettings.json` with the values as required based on the table below in the configuration section.
3. [Optional] Add a shortcut to the app in the windows start up directory as described [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd).

## Usage
This all will run in the system tray and show a small orange Strava Icon while it's running. It will communicate with you via windows notifications. Right clicking on the system tray icon allows you to view log files, the `appsettings.json` and see the current version as well exiting the app.

| Device.Path         | The path in your device (relative to the root) where the activities are stored.

## Compatibility
As this app uses a couple of windows only APIs to send toast notifications and detects devices being connected it's a Windows 10+ only.

## Trouble Shooting
Most errors which the app might encounter as well as diagnostic logs for HTTP calls are logged to the app log. This is located in the same directory as the app is running and can be located by right clicking on the system tray icon and selecting `View Logs`
